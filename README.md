# Stellar Evolution Simulation
## Project Description
Welcome to the Stellar Evolution Simulation, a comprehensive study of star formation and evolution, exploring a modified gravitational field to unravel the intricate processes governing the birth and development of celestial bodies.

## Background
In astrophysics, stars are captivating celestial objects that play a pivotal role in the cosmos. Understanding the complexities of their formation and evolution is a profound pursuit. In this project, we dive into the heart of star creation, embarking on a journey that unveils the unique dynamics of these stellar entities.

## Simulating the Birth of Stars
At the core of our research lies the endeavor to simulate the formation of stars. Our approach is distinguished by the introduction of a modified gravitational field, injecting a novel perspective into the traditional understanding of stellar physics.

## The Physics of Stars
To comprehend the project fully, it's essential to grasp the key equations and principles governing the behavior of stars:

- Hydrostatic Equilibrium: Stars are defined by a delicate balance between gravitational collapse and pressure forces. Hydrostatic equilibrium is the fundamental concept that ensures the stability of stars.

- Mass Continuity: The project investigates the continuity of mass within stars, tracking the flow of matter to comprehend how stars evolve over time.

- Energy Generation: Stars radiate energy through various nuclear processes. The project explores these mechanisms to understand the generation of energy within stars.

- Energy Transport: Heat and energy generated within a star must be transported through its layers. Different mechanisms, such as convection and radiation, are examined in this context.

- Optical Depth: The optical depth of a star is crucial in understanding how light propagates through its layers. It plays a role in determining a star's opacity.
